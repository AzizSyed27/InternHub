# InternHub — CLAUDE.md

## What This Project Is

InternHub is a two-tool Python automation suite that runs on a Mac:

- **Tool 1 — Internship Tracker:** Monitors job sources across 4 tiers on a self-regulating schedule, deduplicates postings, and sends one email per new posting found
- **Tool 2 — LinkedIn Networking Pipeline:** Scrapes LinkedIn alumni pages, finds professionals who went college → university → big tech, and exports a CSV with profile data and AI-generated outreach message drafts

Both tools are independent — separate folders, separate schedules, separate dependencies. Full spec is in `PRD.md`.

## Tool 1 — Internship Tracker

### Four Scraper Tiers

**Tier 1 — ATS JSON APIs (stdlib only)**

| Source | API |
|---|---|
| Greenhouse | `boards-api.greenhouse.io/v1/boards/{slug}/jobs?content=true` |
| Lever | `api.lever.co/v0/postings/{slug}?mode=json&limit=250` |

**Tier 2 — Big Tech Career Page APIs (stdlib only)**

Loop over `BIG_TECH_LOCATIONS`, make one request per location, merge and deduplicate results.

| Company | Endpoint | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Amazon | `https://www.amazon.jobs/en/search.json?base_query={query}&result_limit=100` | ✅ Working — queries `["software intern", "software internship"]` (no stemming); `loc_query` ignored by API |
| Google | `https://careers.google.com/api/jobs/jobs-v1/search/?q=software+intern&location={location}` | ❌ Deprecated as of 2026-04 — no public replacement without auth |
| Microsoft | `https://apply.careers.microsoft.com/api/pcsx/search?domain=microsoft.com&query={query}&start={offset}&num_jobs=100` | ✅ Working — Eightfold PCSX API; old jobs.careers.microsoft.com had SSL mismatch (fixed 2026-04) |
| Apple | `https://jobs.apple.com/api/role/search` (POST) | ❌ Endpoint does not exist — moved to Playwright (`playwright_jobs.py`) |
| Uber | `jobs.uber.com` | ❌ Cloudflare-blocked — moved to Playwright (`playwright_jobs.py`) |

**Tier 3 — Workday ATS JSON API (stdlib only)**

```
POST https://{tenant}.{wd}.myworkdayjobs.com/wday/cxs/{tenant}/{site}/jobs
Headers: Referer: https://{tenant}.{wd}.myworkdayjobs.com/{site}  (required — 422 without it)
Body: {"searchText": "software intern", "limit": 20, "offset": 0, "appliedFacets": {}}
```

Job URL format: `https://{tenant}.{wd}.myworkdayjobs.com/en-US/{site}{externalPath}`

To add a new company: open their Workday careers page in DevTools → Network tab → find the XHR POST to `/wday/cxs/.../jobs` → extract tenant, site name, and wd cluster (wd1/wd3/wd5).

**Tier 4 — Playwright (optional dependency, fail gracefully)**

| Source | Scraper | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Meta | `playwright_jobs.py` | ✅ Rewrote 2026-04: now intercepts GraphQL response at `/graphql` (old CSS selector broke on SPA redesign) |
| Google | `playwright_jobs.py` | ✅ Added 2026-04: DOM scraper on `google.com/about/careers/applications/jobs/results?employment_type=INTERN&q=software`; job cards are `li.lLd3Je`, title `h3.QJPWVe`, link is relative href → prefixed with `/about/careers/applications/`, location from `.wVoYLb` text after `place\n` marker |
| Apple | `playwright_jobs.py` | ✅ Added 2026-04: DOM scraper on `jobs.apple.com/en-ca/search?location=canada-CANC+united-states-USA&key=Software&team=internships-STDNT-INTRN`; job links `ul#search-job-list a[href*='/details/']`, dedup by `.job-posted-date` sibling presence; pagination via `[aria-label="Next Page"]` |
| Uber | `playwright_jobs.py` | ✅ Added 2026-04: response interceptor on `www.uber.com/ca/en/careers/list/?query=Intern&department=University`; `jobs.uber.com` is Cloudflare-blocked but `www.uber.com` is accessible; heuristic JSON traversal finds job array in XHR responses; job URL: `uber.com/global/en/careers/list/{jobId}/` |
| Tesla | `playwright_jobs.py` | ❌ Disabled 2026-04 — Cloudflare blocks headless Chromium (Access Denied). No public API found. |
| Ontario Public Service | `ontario_public.py` | ❌ Disabled 2026-04 — old URL 404; new portal (gojobs.gov.on.ca) uses Radware CAPTCHA |
| OPG | `opg.py` | ✅ Navigates directly to `/search?q={term}` — home page search input is CSS-hidden |
| City of Toronto | `city_toronto.py` | ✅ Updated URL 2026-04: old `toronto.ca/...` was 404; now `jobs.toronto.ca/jobsatcity/search/?q=intern` |
| Govt Canada | `govt_canada.py` | ✅ Updated selector 2026-04: `table.resultTable tr` matched nothing; now `a[href*='page1800']` |
| YC Work at a Startup | `yc.py` | ✅ Authenticated DOM scraper on `workatastartup.com/internships` — logs in via `account.ycombinator.com` (YC_EMAIL/YC_PASSWORD in .env) to unlock full listing (~44 raw jobs); falls back to 15 without credentials; location filter bypassed (tier="github"); old `/jobs.json` was HTTP 500 as of 2026-04 |
| intern-list.com | `playwright_jobs.py` | ✅ Added 2026-04: DOM scraper on Jobright embed pages — US: `jobright.ai/minisites-jobs/intern/us/swe?embed=true`, Canada: `jobright.ai/minisites-jobs/intern/ca/swe?embed=true`; rows: `tr[data-index]`, title: `td[1]`, location: `td[5]`, company: `td[6]`, apply link: `a[href*='/jobs/info/']`; virtual scroll via nearest `overflow-y:auto` ancestor; returns ~900 jobs (US + Canada); location filter bypassed (tier="github", aggregate board like SimplifyJobs); "Multi Locations: X; Y" prefix stripped to first location |

**Community Sources (stdlib only)**

| Source | Scraper | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| SimplifyJobs GitHub repos | `github_repos.py` | Uses `dev` branch, falls back to `main`; HTML `<table>` parser (switched from markdown pipe tables 2026-04); `New-Grad-Positions` currently disabled |
| negarprh/Canadian-Tech-Internships-2026 | `github_repos.py` | Markdown pipe table format; `main` branch only (no dev); 5 columns: Company \| Role \| Location \| Apply \| Date Posted |
| Hacker News Who's Hiring | `hackernews.py` | |

### filters.py behaviour

- `passes_filters(job, tier)` checks: applied-company, applied-public-org (public_sector tier), keyword include (title only), keyword exclude (title only), location (skipped for big_tech and github tiers).
- `title_lower` is used for both include and exclude checks — description is NOT checked. This avoids false positives like "intern" matching "internal" in a senior job's description body.
- Tier 2 + Tier 3 pass `tier="big_tech"` → location check skipped; API query params handle geography.
- GitHub scraper passes `tier="github"` → location check also skipped; SimplifyJobs is a curated global list and filtering by city would drop valid remote/US postings.
- Public sector scrapers pass `tier="public_sector"` → `APPLIED_PUBLIC_ORGS` checked in addition to `APPLIED_COMPANIES`.

### Location Filter Rule

Tier 2 (`big_tech.py`) and Tier 3 (`workday.py`) bypass `LOCATIONS_INCLUDE`. Location filtering is handled by API query parameters using `BIG_TECH_LOCATIONS`. Only keyword and applied-company filters apply to their results.

### Email

- One email per new posting — not a digest
- Subject: `🚀 [Company] — [Job Title] ([Location])`
- HTML dark-mode card: company, role, source badge, location, date, 300-char description excerpt, Apply Now button
- Gmail SMTP + App Password, no OAuth

### Deduplication

- ID: `md5(source_prefix + company + title + url)`
- `seen_jobs.json` stores seen IDs + last run timestamp per scraper

```json
{
  "seen_ids": ["abc123"],
  "last_run": {
    "github_repos": "2026-03-23T14:00:00",
    "greenhouse":   "2026-03-23T14:00:00"
  }
}
```

### Scheduling

`launchd.plist` fires `main.py` every 5 minutes using absolute paths. Each scraper checks its last run time against `SCRAPER_INTERVALS` and skips if not due.

**Seeding behaviour:** On first run (empty `seen_jobs.json`), all current postings are indexed without sending emails. `last_run` timestamps are NOT set during seeding — this ensures all scrapers are immediately due on the very next run, so emails fire right away.

## Scraper Health Watchlist

These scrapers parse HTML or DOM structure directly and are most likely to break silently if the source site changes its layout. Check these first if a scraper suddenly returns 0 results.

| Scraper | File | Status | Risk | Last verified |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| SimplifyJobs repos | `github_repos.py` | ✅ | Switched markdown→HTML tables 2026-04 (fixed). Could change again. | 2026-04 |
| Canadian Tech Internships 2026 | `github_repos.py` | ✅ | Markdown pipe table; added 2026-04. Selectors: column index 0–3 (Company/Role/Location/Apply). If 0 jobs, check repo still uses pipe table format. | 2026-04 |
| Hacker News Who's Hiring | `hackernews.py` | ✅ | Parses HN comment HTML. HN rarely changes layout, but format shift = silent 0 results. | — |
| YC Work at a Startup | `yc.py` | ✅ | Authenticated DOM scraper on `workatastartup.com/internships`. Login via `#ycid-input` + `#password-input` on `account.ycombinator.com/authenticate`. Two DOM layouts: logged-in uses `img[alt]` for company name; logged-out uses `span.font-bold`. Location from first `<span>` in metadata div. If 0 jobs, check selectors or verify credentials. | 2026-04 |
| Meta careers | `playwright_jobs.py` | ✅ | Rewrote 2026-04 to intercept GraphQL response instead of CSS selector (SPA redesign broke old approach). Response key `job_search_with_featured_jobs.all_jobs` could change. | 2026-04 |
| Google careers | `playwright_jobs.py` | ✅ | Added 2026-04: DOM scraper. Selectors `li.lLd3Je` (cards), `h3.QJPWVe` (title), `.wVoYLb` (location). High risk — obfuscated CSS class names could change on any deploy. | 2026-04 |
| Apple careers | `playwright_jobs.py` | ✅ | Added 2026-04: DOM scraper. `ul#search-job-list a[href*='/details/']`; deduped via `.job-posted-date` sibling; `wait_until="load"` + `wait_for_selector` (networkidle never resolves — persistent analytics connections). Pagination via `[aria-label="Next Page"]`. | 2026-04 |
| Tesla careers | `playwright_jobs.py` | ❌ DISABLED | Cloudflare blocks headless Chromium as of 2026-04. No public API found. | 2026-04 |
| Uber careers | `playwright_jobs.py` | ✅ | Added 2026-04: response interceptor on `www.uber.com`. Heuristic JSON traversal finds job array. If 0 jobs returned, inspect XHR on `www.uber.com/ca/en/careers/list/?query=Intern&department=University` and update `_on_response` key path. | 2026-04 |
| Govt Canada | `govt_canada.py` | ✅ | Selector updated 2026-04: `table.resultTable tr` was wrong; now `a[href*='page1800']`. GC jobs uses "student" not "intern" in titles. | 2026-04 |
| Ontario Public Service | `ontario_public.py` | ❌ DISABLED | gojobs.gov.on.ca (new OPS portal) uses Radware CAPTCHA — blocks headless Chromium. | 2026-04 |
| OPG | `opg.py` | ✅ | Playwright, navigates directly to `/search?q=` (home search is CSS-hidden). | 2026-04 |
| City of Toronto | `city_toronto.py` | ✅ | URL updated 2026-04: old `toronto.ca/city-government/...` is 404; now `jobs.toronto.ca/jobsatcity/search/?q=intern`. | 2026-04 |
| intern-list.com | `playwright_jobs.py` | ✅ | Added 2026-04: DOM scraper on `jobright.ai/minisites-jobs/intern/{us\|ca}/swe?embed=true`. Rows: `tr[data-index]`, apply: `a[href*='/jobs/info/']`. Virtual scroll via nearest `overflow-y:auto` ancestor. CSS module class names (`index_bodyViewport`, `index_tableRow`) may change — `tr[data-index]` and `/jobs/info/` href are stable. If 0 jobs, check if `tr[data-index]` still exists on the embed page. | 2026-04 |

**How to spot a broken scraper:** `main.py` now logs `[scraper_name] N jobs returned, M new` for every run. A scraper returning 0 that used to return results is a signal to investigate.

**JSON API scrapers (lower risk):** Greenhouse, Lever, Workday — these return structured JSON. A breaking change usually produces an HTTP error or schema mismatch, not silent 0 results. Amazon's `jobs` list field was silently renamed from `hits` in 2026-04 (fixed).

## Next Steps

- **Find more Canada-focused internship GitHub repos** — `negarprh/Canadian-Tech-Internships-2026` added 2026-04 (markdown pipe table). Look for additional Canadian co-op boards; `github_repos.py` handles both HTML `<table>` and markdown pipe table formats automatically.
- **Uber pagination** — current Playwright response interceptor captures whatever the SPA loads on first render. If there are more than one page of intern results, check whether the page has a "Load more" or pagination control and extend `_scrape_uber()` accordingly.
- **Find ATS for 404 Greenhouse companies** — the following were on Greenhouse but are now 404; find where they moved and add them back: Shopify, OpenAI, Cohere, Ada, Notion, Datadog, Benchling, Rippling, Airtable, Ramp. Check Ashby (`jobs.ashbyhq.com/{slug}`), Workday, or their own careers page.
- **Check Ashby ATS** — several companies that left Greenhouse/Lever have moved to Ashby (e.g., Ramp, Airtable, Linear, Retool). Ashby has a public API at `jobs.ashbyhq.com/api/non-user-graphql` — worth implementing a new `ashby.py` Tier 1 scraper if enough target companies use it.
- **YC scraper** — Fixed and authenticated 2026-04. Now scrapes `workatastartup.com/internships` with YC login. If returning 0, check credentials in `.env` (`YC_EMAIL`/`YC_PASSWORD`) and verify `#ycid-input` / `#password-input` selectors on `account.ycombinator.com/authenticate` still exist.
- **Toronto/GTA company Workday check** — Thomson Reuters, PointClickCare (Mississauga), BlackBerry (Waterloo), OpenText (Waterloo) likely use Workday; find their tenant slugs via DevTools on their careers pages and add to `WORKDAY_COMPANIES`.

## Tool 2 — LinkedIn Networking Pipeline

### How It Works

1. Log into LinkedIn via Playwright using `.env` credentials

### Message Templates

**Connection note (≤300 chars):**
> Hi [Name] — I'm a CS student at Ontario Tech, graduated Centennial. I noticed you took a similar path and landed at [Company]. I'd love to hear your story — would you be open to connecting?

**Follow-up (after acceptance):**
> Hi [Name], my name is Aziz Syed. I'm completing my CS degree at Ontario Tech after graduating from Centennial College. I noticed you went from [College] to [University] and are now a [Role] at [Company] — almost exactly the path I'm hoping to take. After my second year at Centennial, I realized I didn't want to work just anywhere — I want to be at [Company] because of [company-specific value]. Given you've been in my position, what steps would you advise me to take to make that a reality? Even one piece of advice would mean a lot.

Company values come from `company_values.json` — never hallucinate.

## Key Decisions

- **One email per posting** — not a digest. Subject: `🚀 Company — Title (Location)`
- **launchd fires every 5 min** — each scraper self-regulates via `SCRAPER_INTERVALS`
- **Tier 1, 2, 3 all bypass `LOCATIONS_INCLUDE`** — Greenhouse/Lever pass `tier="big_tech"` (same as Tier 2/3); all are curated company lists where you want all intern postings regardless of location. Location filter only applies to community (HN) and public sector tiers.
- **`BIG_TECH_ENABLED` = Tier 2 JSON API scrapers only** (Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Uber) — Apple and Google are `False`; both moved to Playwright
- **`PLAYWRIGHT_JOBS_ENABLED` = Meta, YC, Google, Apple, Uber** (Tesla disabled 2026-04 — Cloudflare blocking)
- **Tier 1–3 are stdlib only** — zero pip installs (except certifi for macOS SSL); YC moved from Tier 3 to Tier 4 (Playwright) in 2026-04 when `/jobs.json` was deprecated
- **Playwright is optional** — Tier 4 scrapers skip gracefully if not installed
- **No LinkedIn automated messaging** — find and log only, all outreach manual
- **MD5 deduplication** — hash of source+company+title+url
- **No database** — JSON for tracker state, CSV for networking output
- **No GitHub Actions** — runs locally on Mac via launchd
- **No web UI** — CLI only for v1
- **seen_jobs.json excluded from git**
- **Open source** — no personal details in logic files, everything in config.py or .env
- **KEYWORDS_INCLUDE = role-level only** — no tech stack terms (backend, frontend, etc.) to avoid matching senior full-time job titles
- **Keyword include checks title only** — not description, to prevent "intern" matching "internal" in a senior job's description
- **Seed run does not set last_run timestamps** — ensures all scrapers are immediately due on the first real run after seeding
- **macOS SSL** — `certifi` added to requirements; `main.py` patches `ssl._create_default_https_context` on startup
- **SimplifyJobs repos use `dev` branch** — `github_repos.py` tries `dev` first, falls back to `main`
- **Workday URL format** — job links require `/en-US/{site}` prefix before `externalPath`; Referer header and `appliedFacets: {}` in POST body are required
- **OPG search** — home page search input is CSS-hidden; scraper navigates directly to `/search?q={term}`
- **Govt Canada** — RSS feed (page2710) removed 2026-04; scraper uses Playwright on page2440; selector is `a[href*='page1800']` (job detail links); GC Jobs uses "student" not "intern" in titles — added "student" to `KEYWORDS_INCLUDE` and `GOVT_CANADA_KEYWORDS`; uses `urllib.parse.quote` (NOT `urllib.request.quote`)
- **YC Work at a Startup** — `/jobs.json` HTTP 500 as of 2026-04; converted to authenticated Playwright DOM scraper on `workatastartup.com/internships`. No XHR API — data is server-rendered. Login flow: `account.ycombinator.com/authenticate` → `#ycid-input` (email) + `#password-input` → submit → `wait_for_load_state("load")` → navigate to `/internships` (session cookie carries over; redirect doesn't auto-follow). Two DOM layouts depending on auth state: logged-in company name is in `a[href*='/companies/'] img[alt]` (text node is empty — only the img alt has the name); logged-out uses `span.font-bold`. Location from first `<span>` in metadata div after job title, with •-bullet fallback. `wait_until="load"` + 3s delay (networkidle never resolves on SPA). `/companies?jobType=intern` URL investigated but shows all jobs at intern-hiring companies (not intern-only) — `/internships` is the correct dedicated page. Location filter bypassed via `tier="github"` (same as SimplifyJobs). Credentials optional — falls back to 15 unauthenticated jobs if `YC_EMAIL`/`YC_PASSWORD` absent. Gated by `PLAYWRIGHT_JOBS_ENABLED["yc"]`
- **`github_repos.py` supports both HTML and markdown pipe tables** — SimplifyJobs uses HTML `<table>` (switched 2026-04); `negarprh/Canadian-Tech-Internships-2026` uses markdown pipe tables. Auto-detected: if `<table` in content → `_TableParser`; else → `_parse_markdown_table()`. Uses `re` (stdlib) for markdown link extraction. No new dependencies.
- **`"github"` tier bypasses location filter** — same mechanism as `"big_tech"` tier; SimplifyJobs is a curated global list so location filtering would drop valid US/remote postings
- **SimplifyJobs company names may have emoji prefixes** — FAANG-tier companies are tagged `🔥, Cloudflare` in the HTML; `APPLIED_COMPANIES` entries must match the exact parsed string; workaround is to rely on Greenhouse/Lever/Workday scrapers for those companies instead
- **New-Grad-Positions disabled** — `SimplifyJobs/New-Grad-Positions` commented out of `GITHUB_REPOS` as of 2026-04; re-enable to include new-grad roles
- **Microsoft careers moved to Eightfold AI (2026-04)** — old `jobs.careers.microsoft.com/global/en/search` had SSL hostname mismatch and is effectively deprecated. New portal is `apply.careers.microsoft.com`, powered by Eightfold AI. The public PCSX search API (`/api/pcsx/search?domain=microsoft.com&query=...&start=N&num_jobs=100`) requires no authentication. Response shape: `data.data.positions[].{id, name, locations[], postedTs, positionUrl}`. Job URL: `https://apply.careers.microsoft.com` + `positionUrl`. Supports pagination via `start` offset.
- **Amazon schema changed 2026-04** — `data["hits"]` is now an integer count; job list is now `data["jobs"]` with flat fields (not nested under `fields`). Fixed in `big_tech.py`.
- **Amazon uses two distinct search terms (2026-04)** — `base_query=software+intern` and `base_query=software+internship` return different job sets (no stemming). `_scrape_amazon()` queries both via `_AMAZON_QUERIES`. The `loc_query` parameter is silently ignored by Amazon's API (any value including nonexistent strings returns the same count) — location loop removed; one request per query with `result_limit=100`.
- **Meta careers redesigned 2026-04** — CSS selector approach broke; `playwright_jobs.py` now intercepts the GraphQL response at `/graphql` and parses `data.job_search_with_featured_jobs.all_jobs`. Job URLs: `metacareers.com/jobs/{id}/`.
- **Google careers Playwright scraper added 2026-04** — old `careers.google.com/api/jobs/jobs-v1/search/` deprecated (301 → 404 at new path). No interceptable JSON API — job data is rendered directly into the DOM. Scraper parses `li.lLd3Je` cards at `google.com/about/careers/applications/jobs/results?employment_type=INTERN&q=software`. Title: `h3.QJPWVe`; location: `.wVoYLb` text after `place\n` marker; URL: relative href prefixed with base. Returns ~18 results (one page). CSS class names are obfuscated and may change on Google deploys — high fragility risk.
- **Apple careers Playwright scraper added 2026-04** — `jobs.apple.com/api/role/search` (old big_tech.py stub) returns 301 → `apple.com/pagenotfound`. The internal `/api/v1/search` endpoint requires a CSRF token fetched by the page's own JS — headless Playwright can't replicate that auth flow (returns `{"res": {"searchResults": [], "totalRecords": 0}}`). Job data IS rendered into the DOM. Scraper navigates `jobs.apple.com/en-ca/search?location=canada-CANC+united-states-USA&key=Software&team=internships-STDNT-INTRN` and parses `ul#search-job-list`. Each card has two `<a>` tags with the same href — title link (has `.job-posted-date` sibling) and "See full role description" (no date sibling); skip the second by checking the date sibling in `page.evaluate()`. Uses `wait_until="load"` + `wait_for_selector` because `networkidle` never resolves (persistent analytics connections). Pagination via `[aria-label="Next Page"]`. `BIG_TECH_ENABLED["apple"]` stays `False`; `PLAYWRIGHT_JOBS_ENABLED["apple"] = True`.
- **Tesla blocked 2026-04** — Cloudflare returns "Access Denied" to headless Chromium. No public API. Disabled in `PLAYWRIGHT_JOBS_ENABLED`.
- **Uber Playwright scraper added 2026-04** — `jobs.uber.com` is Cloudflare-blocked (403). `www.uber.com/ca/en/careers/list/` is an SPA accessible to headless Chromium. No public JSON API endpoint found in JS bundles (abstracted behind Redux `loadSearchJobsResults`). Playwright response interceptor captures XHR responses from `uber.com` and heuristically walks top-level and one level of nesting to find a list of objects with a `title` field. URL: `https://www.uber.com/ca/en/careers/list/?query=Intern&department=University`. Job URL: `uber.com/global/en/careers/list/{jobId}/`. Moved to `PLAYWRIGHT_JOBS_ENABLED`; `BIG_TECH_ENABLED["uber"]` stays `False`.
- **Ontario Public Service broken 2026-04** — old ontario.ca URL is 404; new portal (gojobs.gov.on.ca) uses Radware CAPTCHA. Disabled in `PUBLIC_SECTOR_ENABLED`.
- **City of Toronto URL changed 2026-04** — old `toronto.ca/city-government/...` is 404; scraper now uses `jobs.toronto.ca/jobsatcity/search/?q=intern` with `a[href*='/job/']` selector.
- **main.py per-scraper logging** — each scraper now prints `[name] N jobs returned, M new` every run for diagnostics.
- **intern-list.com added 2026-04** — DOM scraper on Jobright embed pages. The `?k=swe` landing page embeds jobright.ai iframes (not Airtable); the Canada tab also loads via `jobright.ai/minisites-jobs/intern/ca/swe?embed=true`. Navigates directly to the iframe URLs to avoid tab interactions. Table uses virtual scroll — only ~22 rows visible at a time; scrolling the nearest `overflow-y:auto` ancestor loads more. Row selector `tr[data-index]` is stable (data attribute); CSS module class names on cells are obfuscated and may change. Job URLs: `jobright.ai/jobs/info/{id}` (UTM params stripped). Returns ~900 jobs (US + Canada combined). `tier="github"` — aggregate curated board, same as SimplifyJobs; location filter bypassed.
